Defines the following names in z:
  day: conjunction. m=day no; v is verb implementing p1, p2 (add 0 or y at
       end to return noun) see below for details.
  run: run and time day numbers in y (x=0 or monad: only last; x=1: all+summary
  sub: submit last run result for day {. y, part {: y eg. "sub 25 1" or
       "sub 5 2"; shorthand for "1 io_d25_ 0{::RES_d25_"

day runs its code in locale 'dm' with m being the day no. This locale has:
io: monad: get input for the day (for exploration, "run" automatically gets
           input). Caches input files in the current directory.
    dyad : post result y for part x (e.g. 2 io_d25_ 'foobar' submits foobar
    as result for day 25, part 1) Note that "sub" provides shorthand for
    this operation for the last run result (the most common case).
p1, p2   : default to 0:, should be monads defined in v for implementing
the day's parts 1 and 2. day does *not* run p1 and p2 by itself, so
definitions of previous days can be reused without having to wait for
execution results.

The aoc locale has:
  setup year or year setup dir: If dyad, set path to directory having cached input & COOKIE.txt, then setup year, verify cookie, and 
                   fix Android gethttp to use cURL (works on my phone...)
  [ans] req YYYY D P: monad: GET input for year YYYY, day D (P optional and ignored)
                    : dyad : POST ans as answer for YYYY,D, part P (1 or 2)
                             returns some rough text extracted.

NB. day is a conjunction; taking day number and verb implementing day (p1,p2) which will execute in their own locale (named _dx_)
NB.   Before the verb is executed, the locale is set as "dx" with x being the day number.
NB.   Verb "io" is available for getting input (monad y=''), and submitting (dyad, y=solution, x=part(1 or 2); returns some text)
